SledAway's frontend application is created with bleeding-edge `svelte@next` (a.k.a.[SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)). Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte);

## Kicking up the server locally
Prerequisites:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). You should see the app running.
